Installation
------------

This package should be declared as a dependency from other packages, so add it
to the install_requires from setup.py::

    install_requires=[
        'setuptools',
        'sc.policy.helper',
        ],


Or declare it in your dependencies.txt file::

	[sc.policy.helper]

And it will become available to your package.
